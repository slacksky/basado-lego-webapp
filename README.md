 
LEGO Set API 

This is a simple API for retrieving information about LEGO sets.  

Features:  

    GET /lego/sets/:set_num : Retrieves details for a specific LEGO set given its number.  For example, /lego/sets/10276 would return information about the LEGO Colosseum set.
     

Technology Stack:  

    Express.js  - Web framework for Node.js
    Promise API  - For handling asynchronous data fetching.
     

Data Source:  

The legoData object is assumed to provide a function getSetByNum(setNum) that retrieves set information from a database or API (implementation not included in this example).  

To Run:  

    Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
    Clone the repository.
    Install dependencies: npm install
    Start the server: node app.js
     

Note:  This is a basic example and lacks error handling, database integration, and other features commonly found in production APIs.
